# This workflow is independent as it requires write permissions, which GitHub blocks
# on forks for security reasons. Thus, in order to be able to post comments with
# code coverage details on PRs, we run a separate workflow in the context of the
# base repository after any PR build workflow completes, relying on files uploaded
# by the PR's build.
